              Ever since I owned a computer since I was 7 years of age, starting with an old windows 98 and ever since
              then I been interested in computer technology and how it works, but I never really got into
              programming until very recently as i figured i didn't really know
              where a good place to start was.
              <br />
              Spending most of my time behind a computer screen, i decided to stop being the consumer but to
              become the developer which is inspiring me to narrow down my life career path into web development,
              software development, network security, and business intelligence.
              <br />
              Thankfully UCLAx coding bootcamp got me going into the right spot and is helping me figure this
              massive world of programming out.
